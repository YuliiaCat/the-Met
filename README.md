1. I developed a responsive website titled 'The Met' using modern web technologies to showcase The Met museum's landing page. The website features a sleek design with intuitive navigation, providing users with an engaging experience to explore general information such as upcoming events, featured collections, visitor information, and museum exhibitions. The website includes interactive elements such as dynamic resizing of images, buttons that change color, and location links that open in Google Maps.

2. Technologies that to have been used:
-HTML: Used for structuring the content of web pages.

-SCSS: A CSS preprocessor used to streamline CSS development with variables, mixins, and nesting.

-Responsive Design: Implemented with media queries and flexible layouts to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

-Grid Layout: Utilized for creating grid-based layouts, as indicated by the presence of grid-related CSS properties.

-Transition and Animation Effects: CSS transitions and animations were used to create smooth transitions and visual effects on the website.

-Visual Studio Code: used code editor for writing and editing code.

-Web Hosting: The website may have been deployed to a web hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, for public access.
